Instructions:

Each group will need to set up a public Github repository. Every team member will need to publish his/or work to this repository using his/her personal account. The team needs to set up an internal process for merging code to the master/main branch which needs to be described in the final report.

Each team member will be assigned a specific section of the application:

Student A for Overall information of the dataset (responsible of src/data.py, src/test/test_data.py)
Student B for Information on each datetime  column (responsible of src/datetime.py, src/test/test_datetime.py)
Student C for Information on each numeric column (responsible of src/numeric.py, src/test/test_numeric.py)
